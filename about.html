       <h3>How did this all happen?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> Fort Greene Track Club was founded last year and is now hosting their first race in their home park Fort Greene in Brooklyn, NY. About three years ago one of the FGTC members created a Strava segment of their first run in Fort Greene park. This segment is called Fort Greene Hill. </p>


		<h3>The Segment</h3>
	<p align="justify"> The Fort Greene Hill segment is shown below. As you can see the Fort Greene Hill segment is about 0.7 miles long and it is quite hilly. It comprises a loop in the park on paved road, going up the hill first, then following  the road on a short downhill section, passing the stairs, going around the tennis courts and finishing the loop passing the playground and the entrance of the park. The fastest times to complete the segement are in the 5+ minutes range. Since FGTC published it on Strava, more than 300 people ran the segment over 1,000 of times. </p> <br>

	  <h3>What is the goal of the race?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> The goal of the Peachbush Almost 1 Mile race is to have as many people as possible getting into the top 25 of the Strava segment. Currently, there are no FGTC members nearly close to the top 25. PBAM will give each participant the chance to try getting onto the leaderboard multiple times. So strategy on how you plan your attack is key. </p>

	  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> The race will be setup as different waves starting at different times. The first wave will start at 10am. Then, every 10 minutes another wave will run the segment. The maximum people we assign to a wave are 5. This ensures that there won't be too many people on the course at the same time, but enough to keep each other pushing a hard effort. There will be a maximum of 10 waves. You can pick the wave you want to start in. We will have a spreadsheet at the start so you can sign up for specific waves. If the capacity is reached you can't sign up for that specifc wave, but for the next one. Thus, you can run the segment mulitple times. For example, you can do your first run to get to know the course and then use a later wave to push a hard effort, or you can try hard right from the start. To give everyone the possibility to run the segment multiple times we ask you to not sign up for more than 5 waves. </p>

	  <h3>How do you record times?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> FGTC is poor so we can't set up an actual timing system. We are relying on you and your Strava here. As the goal is to get into the segment we ask you to record all your runs. We will scrape all your times from the website later and post the results here. </p>

	  <h3>Do I get a prize when I win?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> No. You will have a fun time with lots of friends. That's better than any award FGTC can give you. All people who register will receive a free entry to FGTC's Annual Gravy Crawl, happening the day after Thanksgiving. </p>	

		<h3>Do you have a bag check?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> We will have an area close to the start where you can drop off a bag. People who are not running will make sure that all items stay there.  </p>	

		<h3>Do you provide race fueling?</h3>
	<p align="justify"> FGTC sponsors water, bagels, and some fruit. We will not have electrolytes or gels. You can make donations if you want to contribute extra supplies. Please reach out to us for more information.  </p>
